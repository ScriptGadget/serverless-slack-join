# serverless-slack-join

An automated way for your team members to sign-up for your Slack.

This was inspired by [serverless-slack-invite-api]((https://github.com/amv/serverless-slack-invite-api)) by Antti Vähäkotamäki, but
I needed something that worked with [Serverless][(https://github.com/serverless/serverless)] v1.0

This is a work in progress. I'll add more documentation when I'm sure it's worth using.
